<body>A<br>
Phong shading is the interpolation between vectors.<br>
Phong lighting is the calculation of the difuse, ambient and specular highlight into a phong reflection model.
<br>B<br>
Flat shading is one calculation per polygon, this makes entire surfaces one distinct color from the shading.<br>

The drawbacks are that no highlight is calculated, if it doesnâ€™t hit any of the points, and color transistions are not possible. <br>
Main feature, it's very fast since very little is calculated. <br>
Gouraud shadings lighting is still done per vertex, exepct now the normals are used on a per pixel basis to make color transitions better <br>
Main feature is that it gives a lot more shadow depth than flat shading could. The drawback is that highlights and lighting erros can become quite large on big triangles <br>
Phong shading moves away from doing the lighting on a per vecticies to a per pixel, this makes it look much more like real life <br>
Main drawback is that it's very intensive to calculate, phong is per fragment, and garoud is per vertices. <br>
Main advantage is that it looks really good, and begins to mimic real light. 


<br>C<br>
Point light is light comes from a singular point, this makes all light originate from a single point<br>
Directional light is that all light comes equally from one direction. An area light infinitely long and infinitely far from the object. <br>
<br>D<br>
Yes normaly we need to known the eye position to calculate glossy values, since we need to know if the camera would see any glossy component<br>
<br>E<br>
That the specular highlight would disapear and no longer be shown, the object is now matte.
<br>F<br>
That the highlight will become smaller.
<br>G<br>
It is calculated in eye space.
